This example shows the ussage of the visitor pattern. 
This pattern should be used if the class hierarchie is preserved but methods tend
to be created all the time. 

In this example we are modelling a simple environmental auditor. 

The elements used for this example are the ecosystem as a whole and also
Trees, Animals, Insects and a River. This element hold the data but not the operations
for this example they all contain fixed values.

The Visitors are the EnvironmentalCalculator and the DegradationCalculator. 
The environmental calculator retrieves and shows the data of all the services provided
by the ecosystem this year.
The degradation calculator retrieves and shows the data of all the costs that society
must assume due to environmental degradation.
